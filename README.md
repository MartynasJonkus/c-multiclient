# c-multiclient
A makeshift central email storage server with two email servers connected, handling multiple clients.  
The two email servers handle communication with their multiple clients and the central server  
The central server communicates with the two email servers and either stores a message or sends back all email messages associated with the requested user  
The users either send a message to anyone by writing their email address followed by the message or write '#post' to receive all their sent and received email messages
